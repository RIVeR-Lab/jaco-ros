DO NOT USE!! AERO only version. Unless you know what you are doing, you probably want the wpi_jaco repo.

Jaco ROS driver - Catkin edition

Currently a work in progress, more to be added (Testers, model, Moveit!, etc)


Currently, files under
jaco-ros/jaco_driver/lib/i386-linux-gnu
have a bug which requires user to manual copy them into devel or install to work.
64 bit version seems unaffected.
